# AVR Baremetal Dev Environment Powered by CMake

This is my personal environment which I use to make my AVR projects.
It supports building multi architecture MCUs in a single projects with easy to use and extensible for a developer.

I use an arduino as my AVR programmer, so I included a *ISP* program as well.

Furthermore, following repositories also included:

- My self-developed AVR Library
- A basic SD Card driver with I/O capabilities
